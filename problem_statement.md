* This project is an agentic AI assistant that helps me schedule my tennis matches and other fitness activities.
The agent connects to my Google Calendar and a Weather API to determine whether I can play at a specified time and location.

* This project starts with the requirement of the Tennis ladder tournament where you need to propose matches to players that they can accept, as well as you have the ability to accept the matches proposed by other players. Players with the most points at the end of the tournament qualify for knockout rounds. 

* To accept a match, I have to go thorugh my calendar to see my availability, check the weather as well as check my workout schedule [cant play after heavy workout day].

* To propose a match, I have to do all of above, plus check for multiple dates, so the overall check scales up. 

* I believe my spare time should be spent on building new things, reading and of course playing tennis. So here we go with this project. 

* My plans also include to potentially work with the ladder tournament app builders to integrate such a service to be made available for all users [and there are a lot of them, in lot of cities!]

* The project will also have all my internal docs, bills, etc to serve as my repository where I can ask questions and analyze life! Of course those docs wont be on the public git repo.
