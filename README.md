This agentic AI helps me with scheduling my tennis matches. 

On a user prompt asking to play a match at a specific time and location, it will use the weather app to see if it is raining and also check my google calendar for availability. If it is possible to play it will add tennis match event on my calendar. 
I can let it know the player name as well so that it can add that to the event name. 

In the future, it will also be able to suggest other potential times that I can play if it is not possible at my prompted time. I can also use the process to add my gym events, and whether I did strength, stability exercise or endurance training to keep a track of all my activities. 
I need to balance weight, stability, endurance and tennis activities.
